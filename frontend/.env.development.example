# Development environment configuration example
# Copy this file to .env.development and adjust values as needed for your local setup

# BACKEND_URL is required for direct video downloads in development environment
# 
# WHY:
# When using window.location.href for direct file downloads in development,
# the frontend proxy (defined in package.json) is bypassed, causing the download request
# to fail if sent to the frontend server instead of the backend server.
#
# WHEN:
# This is only needed in development when:
# 1. Frontend and backend run on different ports (e.g., frontend on 3000, backend on 8080)
# 2. You are using direct navigation for downloads (window.location.href)
#
# WHERE:
# This variable is used in src/utils/api.ts -> getVideoDownloadUrl() function
# to generate the correct absolute URL for video downloads
#
# USAGE:
# Set to the full URL of your backend server including protocol and port
# Example: http://localhost:8080
#
# In production, this is not needed as frontend and backend are served from the same origin

BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
